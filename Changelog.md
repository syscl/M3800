- Huge style change! We don't have to reboot 2x due to the change of ig-platform-id! Once you update your OS X(do not reboot), and run the deploy.sh again, then, you can enjoy every functions of OS X you want.

- Another problem is that after a full sleep, I can't reproduce the fix I made to fix the HP lose sound problem after a cold boot, really boring since I usually plug in HP all the time. I'm finding new way to fix this annoying problem. (After extensive explore, I believe this bug is produced by AppleHDA, since there's no such problem under Windows and Linux. Actually, Linux has this bug, but it can be fixed through a re-plugged-in HP.)
